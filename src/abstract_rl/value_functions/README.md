# Value Functions

Here are the value functions implemented. There are basically two value functions, namely the q function and the
v function. They support the Vanilla Gradient and can be simply switched to the Trust Region Gradient. They depend
on the fields tv or tq respectively. These fields can be generated by a operator, e.g. retrace or td operator.
For testing purposes a version of the Stochastic Dueling Networks (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01224,
