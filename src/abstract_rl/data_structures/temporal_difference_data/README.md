# Temporal Difference Data

There are at most two types of TD-data:

## Trajectories

They the projects main data structure. They can be generated inside a TrajectoryCollection by
using the supplied Environment using the TrajectoryBuilder.

## Batches 

A batch is a somehow shuffled up version of the Trajectories. They can be generated by a TrajectoryCollection
or the CircularTailMemory.
